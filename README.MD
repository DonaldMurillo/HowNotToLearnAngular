# HOW IS IT ALL (NOT) SET UP
- Created using Dev Containers 
	- Needs Docker
	- Visual Studio Code
	- Remote Containers Extension
- On the folder you want to start your container, click the green icon at the bottom right corner of your VSC and select Reopen with container
- Added all relevant (to me) extensions to the .devcontainers file.
- Installed Angular CLI `npm install -g @angular/cli` (v12 was installed). https://angular.io/cli
- Created a new angular project using `ng new app-name --routing --style=scss`
	- `ng` is Angular CLI
	- `new app-name` is the command we ran, in this case it is a new app
	- `--routing` it is a command option to make a routing module
	- `--style=scss` it is a command option to make scss the default style sheet file/format. https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/using-sass-with-the-angular-cli
